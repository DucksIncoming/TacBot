# TacBot
Random tic-tac-toe bot I made bc i was bored

There are 4 different modes:
Linear: Just picks boxes sequentially
Random: Picks a square randomly
Fill: Looks for places where either opponent or computer can win (2 in a row with one free space) and fills the empty square
Godmode: Fillstrat, tries to start in the middle to avoid L strat win

I didn't feel like making a """perfect""" computer by just explicitly checking the end result of any move bc that's lame so this is close enough, as far as I can tell it can't lose.
